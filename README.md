# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to postprocess MESH outputs, such as water balance outputs, energy balance both in the basin-averaged and gridded results

## Observations
Contains observations such as GRACE and snow products used to evaluate model outputs.  

## Water Balance
The water balance folder contains scripts to calculate and plot the water balance outputs. 

## Streamflow
The water balance folder contains scripts to calculate and plot the streamflow outputs.
